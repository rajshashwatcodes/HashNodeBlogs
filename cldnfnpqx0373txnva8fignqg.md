# Machine Learning Classification

There are many types of Machine Learning Systems which can be classified into different categories, based on certain criteria.

## 1️⃣ Type of Data/Human Supervision

Whether model training involves human supervision or not.

Different Machine Learning Systems based on Human Supervision:

🟢 Supervised Learning  
🟡 Semi-Supervised Learning  
🟠 Unsupervised Learning  
🔴 Reinforcement Learning

## 2️⃣ Mode of Learning

Whether the model is capable of learning incrementally on the stream of incoming data or not.

Different Machine Learning Systems based on Mode of Learning:

🟠 Online Based Learning  
🟡 Batch-Based Learning

## 3️⃣ Working Approach

Whether the model is comparing new and known data points or is it detecting patterns in the training data and building predictive models.

Different Machine Learning Systems based on Working Approach:

🔴 Instance-Based Learning  
🟣 Model Based Learning

Of course, these criteria are not exclusive and are be combined in any way to create an effective model.

Every Machine Learning Model fall under one Machine Learning System from each category.

Let's see an example

### ✉️ Spam filter

It learns on the fly using the Deep Neural Network model, which is trained using examples of spam and ham, ultimately predicting mail category.

It is using models from all three categories:

🟠 Online Based Learning  
🟣 Model Based Learning  
🟢 Supervised Learning
